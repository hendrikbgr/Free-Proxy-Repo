# 🔥 Version 0.0.3 🔥

This is the first version of my fully automated github repo & proxy scraper. My proxy scraper & checker is running on my local raspberry pi 4+ and is updating the proxy list once scraped and checked. After that it will restart the whole progress.

My script crawls over 60+ Websites and more then 270+ urls and finds all public proxies available. All proxies are checked before they get updated here.

# Proxy Scraper & Checker
